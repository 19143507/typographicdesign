<h1>Hello There! Welcome to Our Page!</h1>

<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>We’re Carlligraphy, (clever name, right?), and we are dedicated to explaining how cars and typography both heavily influence one another, as it can be a rather confusing combination to understand at first.</p>
<p>Established in 2021, Carlligraphy is your go to place for all things fast and typographical.</p>
<p>This probably wasn’t a combination you ever knew you needed in your life, but trust us when we say you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it.</p>

<h2>Typography & Cars?</h2>

<body>
<p>From Formula 1 to Formula 4, from Rallycross to Karting; typography influences them all, and in a plethora of different ways too.</p>
<p>Not only does typography influence the upper echelons of motor racing, but it also influences our own personal cars as well.</p>
<p>Your very own car and the whole process of you purchasing it have been manipulated by typography.</p>
<p>Weird right?</p>

<h2>Meet Our Founder</h2>

<body>
<p>Hello everyone, I'm Patrick, the founder of Carlligraphy!</p>
<p>My years on planet Earth only add up to a measly 19 years, but if there's one thing you should know about my time so far, it's that it consists mostly of "fan-boying" over these delectable pieces of machinery, more commonly known as cars.</p>
<p>Fast cars are, of course, even better!</p>
<p>I was first introduced to the concept of typography in school and it was a part of my favourite subject: English.</p>
<p>Essentially, this is how Carlligraphy came into existence; a mere question of whether one could combine their favourite pasttime with their favourite academic subject.</p>
<p>That question is what we are trying to answer, so let's get to work and let's see how far we can take it!</p>
