## Let's Clear Something Up

About you pages can typically be quite boring; so we'll keep this short and sweet so you can go and expore some of our articles!

## Who Are We?

We're Carlligraphy, (clever name, right?), and we are dedicated to explaining how cars and typography both heavily influence one another, as it can be a rather confusing combination to understand at first. 

Established in 2021, Carlligraphy is your go to place for all things fast and typographical.

This probably wasn't a combination you ever knew you needed in your life, but trust us when we say you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

## What Do We Do Exactly?

From Formula 1 to Formula 4, from Rallycross to Karting; typography influences them all, and in a plethora of different ways too. Not only does typography influence the upper echelons of motor racing, but it also influences our own personal cars as well. Your very own car and the whole process of you purchasing it have been manipulated by typography. Weird right?

If you would like to know more, we have several articles going into detail on these topics so please feel free to check them out!
