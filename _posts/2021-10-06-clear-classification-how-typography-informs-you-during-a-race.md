Cars come in all shapes and sizes, but the best ones for sure, are the ones that take to the track to compete. 

## Typography in Motorsport?

Motorsport grand prix racing is fantastic. The adrenaline it creates within the soul and the tension it scatters into the air cannot be rivalled by any other sporting industry on the planet. Yet, as I write this, it occurs to me that every piece of necessary context regarding a race cannot be personified through the camera work of a broadcasting team. Typography is required to convey all the necessary information about a race, or the particular series, to the spectators.

## Where Can I Find It?

Typography that is used to help the motorsport broadcasting process can be divided into many different categories.

So lets analyse them.

The first example of this can be found in the form of the race classification. Every motorsport race broadcast will have this on display in some shape or form, but the exact designs will depend on the specific broadcasters, as some motorsport categories are broadcast by the same company, and some different. The country that a race is being viewed from will also impact this, therefore, I am only able to speak from a Brits perspective

Formulas 1, 2 and 3 are all broadcast by F1 themselves so they all share the same basic race classification design layout. The design can be described as a thin, black panel that can be located on the left hand side of the screen; around one fifth of the screen is continuously covered by this. 

The white typography itself is extremely basic, which makes it very legible against the black background. The heavyweight text that is presented with a regular amount of width between the graphemes, perfectly conveys the information that the broadcasters feels is important for the viewers to be aware of. Combined with the emphatic typographic voice and the low contrast, the broadcasters at F1 have ensured that at no point during the racing sessions, shall the typography used to present the race classifications blend in with the background in any capacity. This also helps make it significantly easier for viewers to follow along. 

In contrast to this, the broadcasters of the EuroFormula Open Championship have not done such a fantastic job with implementing typography into their race broadcasts, specifically when it comes to their classification graphic. 

Their text is white and basic, like F1, but that is where the similarities end. The condensed and high contrast text does not complement the royal blue background of the graphic at all, making the text far more difficult to read. In addition, the text is rather tentative on the screen, so whilst it doesn't jump off the screen and distract the viewers from the action on track, it is also overshadowed by its own background colour. This reasoning alone is perfect for critiquing EuroFormula's typographic decision making. 

Another example of how typography is used in motorsport, that I thought could be quite interesting to discuss, is how adverts are shown during race broadcasts. 

Top tier motorsport categories typically have exclusive sponsorship deals with high end businesses and this results in them having exclusive graphics and adverts that only they can use.

In the US, categories such as IndyCar and IndyLights have deals with NTT and Cooper Tyres respectively, and this earns these companies title sponsorship status. Essentially, this means that on TV these categories are referred to as **NTT IndyCar Series** and **IndyLights Presented By Cooper Tyres.** The broadcasts are heavily influenced by these deals as a result, as seen through their TV graphics and typography. 

IndyCar is a brilliant example of this, but is important to note that the typographic decisions are not necessarily down to them, but rather their sponsors, as the brand logos are often being displayed on the broadcasts. The brands do all have relatively similar logos, in typographical terms.

Two brands that are synonymous with IndyCar: Firestone and AutoNation both have relatively similar typographies as they're very heavyweight and emphatic. Obviously this is an attempt to court as many eyes as possible to their brand logo, as they try and appeal to as many racing fans as possible who may be watching IndyCar.

## Is Typography Good For Motorsport?

In short yes it definitely is because it serves so many good purposes in regards to motorsport broadcasting. It allows for brands to come in and inject our favourite racing categories with the necessary cash to keep them afloat. 

If broadcasters were unwilling to design their typography around these sponsors, there would be no high end competitive racing. 

Furthermore, typography also means that viewers don't have to sit and view an entire racing without blinking as the typography on the side of the screen helps viewers stay on top of all of a race's events, making the sport far easier to follow, without having to use too much brain power, allowing for viewers o relax whilst they watch a race unfold.
