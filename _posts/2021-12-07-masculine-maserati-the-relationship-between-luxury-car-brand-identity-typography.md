The automobile industry is thought of as being traditionally masculine, with almost all car manufacturers having been founded by men. But many other important questions remain unanswered, such as, how do brands use typography to represent themselves? And how do they use it to convey a message of luxury, alongside speed, power and precision?

## Maserati

Maserati prides itself on it's long and glorious sporting heritage, and this is reflected significantly in their logo's typography. 

The typography in this logo screams class and luxury to let potential customers know that when they're purchasing a Maserati, they're buying into a long line of fantastic Italian automotive excellence. 

There is a consistent x-height across the entire logo involving all of the lower case graphemes which makes the logo look extremely neat and sophisticated. It also adds an impressive level of professionality to the logo. The weight is rather regular as it doesn't want to stand out and be too impactful, but rather sensible and reserved, like the luxury reputation Maserati are trying to convey. The typographical width is somewhat extended to give the typography a little bit of personality so that it's not completely boring and uncharacteristic. 

Maserati have opted to use a font that I actually cannot identify as I've never seen it before. It's so incredibly unique and different that it portrays Maserati as being of the upmost class and quality, to the point where other car brands will not be able to replicate them in any capacity, not even with their brand logos. 

This again gives Maserati a supreme amount of individuality.

## Ferrari

Ferrari is by far the most recognisable name on this list. What was once a little car manufacturer that was founded of out Alfa Romeo's racing division in Modena, Italy, in 1939, is now a supermassive, luxury automobile conglomerate. 

Their logo and its typography is also unique, in order to help Ferrari consolidate their reputation as one of the stand out manufacturers in the global automobile market, in that they have their logo set in lowercase. This also helps keep the distance between their baseline and x-height extremely steady and consistent. The weight of the text is fairly regular, so not too, heavy but also not to light. It's simple, basic, and does the job well. 

Another unique aspect of Ferrari's logo typography is that the spacing between the letters is perhaps a little bit extended from a normal width, alongside with the slight typographical contrast, which helps the logo appear as more dramatic and impactful. It could also be suggested that the extended width helps the viewer of the logo take slightly more time to read the name 'Ferrari' in their minds, thereby making the name appear as considerably more important and powerful, compared to a logo that can be read and understood considerably quicker.

## Jaguar

Jaguar are one of the most respectable British car manufacturers. Despite being owned by Ford, Jaguar continues to identify with it's British heritage, and until 2004, even competed in F1 under a British license.

Primary typeface Jaguar is an extended modular sans-serif style, echoing the letterform proportions of the Jaguar logo, but with far less contrast. 

The typeface is rather bespoke too as it is created by the people at Fontsmith.com with clean lines and bold, strong curves. Jaguar's typography is set in all caps which is of stark contrast to Ferrari, and this is further represented by the width between the baseline and cap-height being perfectly consistent, which suggests Jaguar are looking to portray themselves as being consistently neat, tidy, sleek, and the most premium British manufacturer in the industry. 

But what is similar to Ferrari's typography is the extended space between the graphemes, which again, is most certainly used for impact and dramatic effect. it adds a new dimension of typographical boldness that is not seen in other manufacturer's logos.

## Pagani

A small company that makes roughly a handful of cars each year by hand allows Pagani to claim to be the ultimate showstoppers of craftsmanship and engineering.

The fact that Pagani take such good care and precision behind their decision making and crafting of their sportscars is further emphasised by their logo and its typography. 

Firstly, the colours on the logo are very basic and mainly consist of white and silver, which supports Pagani's philosophy of being a hand-crafted, non-automated car manufacturer, based on the fact that the logo does not look too advanced or complex. The difference between the cap-height and baseline is also extremely consistent, and with the regular weight and low contrast text to add further detail to the logo, this emphasises and maintains Pagani's reputation as being able to deliver a high quality product without the need for overly complex processes or unnecessary details. 

With Pagani, it is evident that they are a manufacturer that is terrifically capable of over-delivering, with regards to the resources at their disposal and the processes in which they conduct.
