## What Are Sponsors In Motorsport?

Motorsport is an extremely expensive industry for everyone involved and needs thunderous amounts of money to be pumped into it to keep it alive. This mostly affects the drivers as they are usually the ones who are required to bring the finances to a team for that team to operate and compete. 

But where do they get their money from I hear you ask? The answer is simple: sponsors.

Drivers will often have a management team working on their behalf to approach sponsors and arrange the deals, but that's not to say the driver's are not involved, as they need to provide the sponsors with the incentives to sponsor them in the first place. There are several incentives that a driver can offer a company, and typography is an incredibly integral part of how these deals come to fruition.
